## **[Deap learning for automated triaging of stable chest radiographs in a follow-up setting](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.230606)**

Using image registration and subtraction, a deep learning algorithm could triage no-change chest radiograph pairs while detecting urgent interval changes regardless of abnormality type and number during longitudinal follow-up.
- A deep learning algorithm developed using more than 3 million chest radiographs can triage no-change radiograph pairs during longitudinal follow-up.
- While triaging 40% of true no-change pairs, the algorithm accurately detected a true change in two internal test sets: 88% in the emergency department (ED) and 90% in the intensive care unit (ICU).
- While triaging 40% of no-change pairs, the algorithm detected 79%–100% (ED) and 86%–94% (ICU) of changes in urgent findings (consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax).
